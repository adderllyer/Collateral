# Collateral

This repository provides access to the latest presentations and events. This way, you can take a 
look at the slides if you missed an event, or use the content if you want to do a presentation about 
the Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC) yourself.

## Contributing

Please feel free to add content. However, by doing so, please pay attention to comply to the 
following guidelines:
- The date of folder and file names have to match the following pattern: YYYY-MM-DD. Just take a 
  look at the already uploaded files.
  - Files should provide information about the concrete day.
  - Folders should be named by year and month: YYYY-MM.
- Files (e.g. presentation slides) of one event are located within a folder for this specific event.
- Always add a file in the raw format (e.g., `.pptx`) **and** a finalized one (`.pdf`).

This way, people can access information fast and (hopefully) without too much effort. All files are
automatically sorted by alphabet and number, so the aforementioned naming style allows finding
events according to their date real quick.
